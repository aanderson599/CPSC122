CPSC 122: Computer Science II
=============================
All files created during the Spring 2019 semester of CPSC 122 at Gonzaga University

## Project 1: Virtual Machine Configuration
Project 1 involved the successful configuration of a lUbuntu Virtual Machine that would be used over the duration of the semester

## Project 2: Prime Number Generator
Project two required the implementation of a prime number finder as a way to review C++ topics from CPSC121

## Project 3: Implementing String Manipulation Methods
Projects involved the creation of the my_strcpy and my_strcmp functions on arrays of characters, essentially recreating existing string manipulation methods

## Project 4: Selection Sort
Project uses file i/o to read a list of names from a file, use selection sort to sort the names into alphabetical order, then output the sorted list to a file

## Project 5: Classes
Project introduces classes in C++ and implements the class MyString along with multiple functions used for string manipulation. Implements the MyString class using the standard three-file format

## Project 6: Simple Linked List
Project implements a simple linked list that allows using a struct and pointers. Introduces constructors and destructors and implements the class using the three-file format. 

## Project 7: Pointer Manipulation and Linked Lists
Project implements a more complicated linked list with the capability to manipulate the head and tail pointers of the list, as well as search for elements in the list

## Project 8: Advanced Constructors
Project implements a linked list with a copy constructor and the capacity to manipulate an element at any location in the list

## Project 9: Doubly Linked List
Project implements a doubly linked list with the capability to traverse forward and backward from any element in the list for easy insertion and deletion

## Project 10: Calculator
Project implements a command line calculator and a Stack data type. The stack inherits from List and in conjunction with a hash table works to parse user input and separate parenthesis and operators from numbers to produce the correct output

## Project 11: Calculator Again

## Project 12: Two Queues and Inheritance
Project implements a circular queue and a priority queue which both inherit from List
